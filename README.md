## Output the Kohn-Sham orbitals from the open source DFT code Elk

The subroutines contained in this repository are modifications of existing Elk subroutines. Adding these to the /src/ directory after downloading the Elk code will allow you to to extract the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals of a specific band of interest at a specific k point on a grid in real space in one, two or three dimensions.

The new subroutines are init9, psik, psiplot and psish and they require the use of the module modmain2. The main elk.f90 file must also be updated so that the new subroutines can be accessed.

In order to use extract the KS orbitals on a grid, set the tasks in the input file to 961 for plotting in 1D, 962 for plotting in 2D and 963 for 3D plotting. These tasks are very similar to tasks 61, 62, and 63 which plot the wavefunction
squared in 1D, 2D or 3D. To specify the regions where plotting is wanted, look at specifications for the plot1d, plot2d and plot3d subroutines in the elk manual situated in the /docs/ directory. 

Tasks 961, 962 and 963 output the real and imaginary parts of the up and down components of the KS spinors separately. Each task therefore outputs 4 files, one for each of the components in the specified region.
